IT-Based Learning

## Abstract of our paper
In a rapidly digitizing world, the significance of Information Technology (IT) and digital solutions is evident in driving societal and economic transfor-mations. 
This paper discusses the importance of equipping the next generation with programming knowledge and addresses the challenges educational institutions face in updating their curriculum to match the pace of AI advancements. 
The paper introduces "Autonomous Learning," an educational software that utilizes AI to teach basic programming skills. 
By enabling users to express coding concepts in natural language, which is then translated into Python code, the software offers an innovative approach to learning. 
This approach not only simplifies the introduction to programming but also teaches handling large language models, specifically GPT-4. 
The game's objectives are mapped using Bloom's Taxonomy, ensuring a structured and progressive learning experience. 
The backend is driven by the FastAPI and OpenAI's GPT-4 model, ensuring efficient translation of natural language in-to code. 
Feedback from high school students during a pilot test provided val-uable insights into the software's effectiveness and potential areas of im-provement.
